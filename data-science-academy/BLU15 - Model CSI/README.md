# Big Learning Unit 15 - Model CSI

## Note:
That's the students version of BLU. It will be replaced with the instructor's version after 10.01.2021.

The students are still doing the BLU, so I don't want to publish the solution before they finish.

## What is in this BLU?

This is the third unit of DS in the Real World specialization. In this learning unit you're going to find out how to diagnose an existing model, identify issues and redeploy the model. 

#### Main topics

- Model diagnosing (for performance and client requirements)
- Calibrating and fixing model problems
- Redeploying the model


## Additional notes
Don't forget to install the requirements using the requirements.txt file for this BLU!
